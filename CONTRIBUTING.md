Contributing
============

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to this CubicleSoft project!  Sincere help is always appreciated.

Before you open an issue on the issue tracker, fork the repo, or start a pull request, there are some simple guidelines that help reduce the amount of time required to handle the request and keeps the repository neat and clean:

* Don't open an issue or pull request just for your personal benefit but rather for the benefit of the larger community.  "How can I help other people?"  A large percentage of requests are closed because submitters don't follow this guideline.
* Requests will be rejected if they implicitly create a security vulnerability.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  A surprisingly large percentage of requests are rejected because submitters don't follow this guideline.
* Forking a repository is serious business.  If you are making changes to 5 lines of code or fewer, a fork + pull request is a waste of everyone's time, including yours.  Just use the issue tracker.
* It would be really nice if all pull requests carefully respected the existing coding style.  All of the initial source code here is written in Crimson Editor with:  Autoindent turned off, no automatic coding of any sort, trailing spaces/tabs are removed on save, forced UNIX line endings, tab-indented, and carefully written against a set style (e.g. braces on their own line, single space after keywords unless casting, liberal use of parenthesis, etc).

These guidelines are just that:  Guidelines.  The purpose of the guidelines is to maintain zero open issues/pull requests across all repositories without going insane.  Sanity matters.  These guidelines actually apply to every incrementally maintained repository everywhere, not just CubicleSoft.

Keeping these things in mind, contribute away!
